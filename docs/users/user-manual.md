## Beginner — Daily Basics

Everything you need to use Kōan day-to-day. If you've just installed Kōan, start here.

### Your First Mission

Send a message to Kōan via Telegram (or Slack). If it looks like a task, Kōan automatically queues it as a mission:

> *"Audit the auth module for security issues"*

For explicit control, use the `/mission` command:

```
/mission Refactor the payment service to use async/await
```

**`/mission`** — Queue a new mission for the agent to work on.

- **Usage:** `/mission <description>`
- **Options:**
  - `/mission --now <description>` — Insert at the top of the queue (next to run)
  - `/mission [project:webapp] <description>` — Target a specific project

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/mission Add input validation to the signup form` — Queue a feature task
- `/mission --now Fix the broken CI pipeline` — Urgent fix, skip the queue
- `/mission [project:api] Write integration tests for the /users endpoint` — Target a specific project
</details>

### Mission Lifecycle

Every mission flows through a simple lifecycle:

```
Pending  →  In Progress  →  Done ✓
                          →  Failed ✗
```

1. **Pending** — Queued and waiting. Kōan picks missions from the top of the queue.
2. **In Progress** — Kōan is actively working on it via the configured CLI provider.
3. **Done** — Completed successfully. Code is in a `koan/*` branch, often with a draft PR.
4. **Failed** — Something went wrong. Kōan logs the reason and moves on.

By default, Kōan processes one mission at a time. When idle, it picks the next pending mission automatically. For concurrent execution, see [Parallel Sessions](#parallel-sessions).

### Chatting with Kōan

Just send a regular message — Kōan classifies it automatically. Short conversational messages get instant replies (chat mode). Task-like messages get queued as missions.

#### Chat Command Suggestions

When you write a message that maps to an existing slash command, Kōan will suggest it:

> "That sounds like a job for `/resume_recurring` — want me to queue it?"

Suggestions are advisory — you always stay in control. If you like the suggestion, send the command; otherwise, Kōan continues the conversation. Suggestions are opt-in and can be disabled via the `chat.suggest_commands: false` config flag.

#### Forcing Chat Mode

If Kōan misclassifies your message, use `/chat` to force chat mode:

**`/chat`** — Force a message to be treated as chat, not a mission.

- **Usage:** `/chat <message>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/chat What do you think about using Redis for caching?` — Ask for an opinion without creating a mission
- `/chat How's your day going?` — Just talk
</details>

### Managing Your Queue

**`/list`** — See all pending and in-progress missions.

- **Aliases:** `/queue`, `/ls`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/list` — Check what's queued up before adding more work
- `/ls` — Quick glance at the queue
</details>

**`/cancel`** — Remove a pending mission from the queue.

- **Usage:** `/cancel <number>` or `/cancel <keyword>`
- **Aliases:** `/remove`, `/clear`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/cancel 3` — Cancel the 3rd pending mission
- `/cancel auth` — Cancel the mission matching "auth"
</details>

**`/abort`** — Abort the current in-progress mission and move to the next one.

- **Usage:** `/abort`
- The running Claude subprocess is killed, the mission is moved to Failed, and the agent loop picks the next pending item.

**`/priority`** — Move a pending mission to a different position in the queue.

- **Usage:** `/priority <n>` (move to top) or `/priority <n> <position>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/priority 5` — Move mission #5 to the top of the queue
- `/priority 3 2` — Move mission #3 to position #2
</details>

### Checking Progress

**`/status`** — Get a quick overview of Kōan's state: what's running, what's queued, loop health.

- **Aliases:** `/st`
- **Related:** `/ping` (is the loop alive?), `/usage` (detailed quota), `/metrics` (success rates), `/version` (version only)

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/status` — "Is Kōan working? What's it doing?"
- `/ping` — Quick health check
- `/metrics` — See mission success/failure rates
</details>

**`/live`** — See real-time progress from the currently running mission.

- **Aliases:** `/progress`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/live` — Check what Kōan is doing right now during a long mission
</details>

**`/logs [run|awake|all]`** — Show the last 20 lines from log files, formatted in code blocks.

- **Default:** Shows only `run.log`. Use `awake` for bridge logs, `all` for both.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/logs` — Quick check of recent agent output (run.log only)
- `/logs awake` — Check bridge/Telegram polling output
- `/logs all` — See both run and awake logs
</details>

**`/quota [remaining_%]`** — Check remaining API quota (live, no cache), or override the internal estimate.

- **Aliases:** `/q`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/quota` — See how much API budget is left before adding heavy missions, plus the rolling burn rate (%/h) and estimated time to exhaustion
- `/quota 32` — Tell Kōan it has 32% remaining (fixes drift when internal estimate is wrong)
- If Kōan is paused due to quota but the API is actually available, `/quota 50` will correct the estimate and clear the pause
- When the burn rate predicts session exhaustion in less than 30 min, the autonomous mode is automatically downgraded one tier (deep→implement→review). A Telegram alert fires once when projected exhaustion is under 60 min and the next quota reset is still more than 2 h away.
</details>

**`/check_notifications`** — Force an immediate check of GitHub and Jira notifications, bypassing the exponential backoff timer.

- **Aliases:** `/read`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/read` — When the queue is empty and you know there are pending notifications
- `/check_notifications` — After posting a GitHub comment that should trigger a mission
</details>

**`/inbox`** — Force a GitHub notification check and show how many GitHub-originated missions are queued.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/inbox` — Quick check: "do I have GitHub mail?" — triggers a fetch and shows pending 📬 mission count
</details>

**`/verbose`** / **`/silent`** — Toggle real-time progress updates. When verbose is on, Kōan sends progress messages as it works.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/verbose` — Turn on updates when you want to follow along
- `/silent` — Turn off updates when you're busy (default)
</details>

### Branch Isolation & Reviewing Work

Kōan **never commits to `main`**. All work happens in `koan/*` branches (the prefix is configurable). After completing a mission, Kōan typically:

1. Creates a branch like `koan/refactor-payment-service`
2. Commits changes with clear messages
3. Pushes the branch and creates a **draft PR**

Your workflow:

```bash
# See what Kōan produced
git log koan/refactor-payment-service

# Review the PR on GitHub
# Merge when you're satisfied — or ask Kōan to iterate
```

**The agent proposes. The human decides.** — You always have the final say.

### Multi-Project Basics

Kōan can manage multiple projects simultaneously. It rotates between them based on queue priority and quota.

**`/projects`** — List all configured projects.

- **Aliases:** `/proj`
- Shows each project's configured issue tracker when set.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/projects` — See which repos Kōan is managing
</details>

**`/tracker`** — Show or configure per-project issue tracker routing.

- **Usage:** `/tracker`
- **Set GitHub:** `/tracker set <project> github [repo:owner/repo] [branch:main]`
- **Set Jira:** `/tracker set <project> jira key:PROJ [type:Task] [branch:11.126]`

This controls where `/plan` creates new tracker issues and how Jira-origin `/fix` and `/implement` resolve the target repo and branch.

Jira project keys are registered per project in `projects.yaml`. The project path can be configured there with `path:` or discovered from `KOAN_ROOT/workspace/<project-name>`. The old `instance/config.yaml jira.projects` mapping is ignored; `/config_check` reports it as a migration warning.

**`/alias`** — Create short aliases for project names. Once set, typing `/<shortcut> <text>` queues a mission tagged with the aliased project.

- **Usage:** `/alias <project> <shortcut>` — create an alias. `/alias` — list all aliases.
- **Examples:** `/alias Template2 tt`, then `/tt fix the build` queues a mission for Template2.

**`/unalias`** — Remove a project alias.

- **Usage:** `/unalias <shortcut>`

**`/focus`** — Lock Kōan to a single project. While focused, it only processes missions for that project and skips exploration/reflection.

- **Usage:** `/focus [duration]` (default: 5 hours)
- **Examples:** `/focus`, `/focus 3h`, `/focus 2h30m`

**`/unfocus`** — Exit focus mode, resume normal multi-project rotation.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/focus` — "I need all attention on the webapp for the next few hours"
- `/focus 1h` — Short focused sprint
- `/unfocus` — "OK, back to normal"
</details>

**`/passive`** — Enter passive (read-only) mode. The agent loop keeps running (heartbeat, GitHub notification polling, Telegram commands) but never executes missions or autonomous work. Missions accumulate as Pending.

- **Usage:** `/passive [duration]` — no duration = indefinite
- **Examples:** `/passive`, `/passive 4h`, `/passive 2h30m`

**`/active`** — Exit passive mode and resume normal execution. Queued missions drain naturally.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/passive` — "I'm at the desk, don't touch anything"
- `/passive 4h` — "Hands off for the next 4 hours"
- `/active` — "I'm done, you can work again"
</details>

### Permanent Focus Mode

Focus mode can be made permanent via config, turning Kōan into a pure mission executor. When enabled, the agent only runs missions you explicitly queue — it never picks up GitHub issues autonomously, never runs contemplative reflection, and never enters DEEP mode. The loop keeps polling Telegram, GitHub notifications, and recurring schedules, so it still wakes up the moment you queue something.

This extends the `/focus` Telegram command (which is time-bounded) into a permanent config-level switch.

- **Enable globally in `instance/config.yaml`:**
  ```yaml
  focus: true
  ```
- **Or via environment variable:** `KOAN_FOCUS=1` (takes precedence over `config.yaml`).
- **Per-project in `projects.yaml`:**
  ```yaml
  defaults:
    focus: true          # All projects focused by default
  projects:
    myapp:
      focus: false       # Override: allow autonomous work on myapp
  ```
- **Disable:** set back to `false`, or `KOAN_FOCUS=0`.

What continues to run under focus mode:

- Missions queued via `/mission`, GitHub `@mention` commands, and recurring schedules.
- Heartbeat, auto-update, Telegram polling, GitHub notification polling, CI queue drain.

What is disabled:

- DEEP mode (capped at `implement`).
- Contemplative sessions (random reflection rolls are skipped).
- Autonomous exploration (the loop idles with wake-on-mission when no mission is pending).
- The agent prompt's `GitHub Issue Selection` section is replaced with an explicit "do not pick up issues" instruction.

**How it differs from `/passive`:** passive mode blocks all execution (missions sit as Pending until you `/active`). Focus mode keeps the executor running for any mission you queue — it only gates *autonomous work selection*.

**When to use:**

- You want Kōan to act strictly on demand, no surprises on the PR list.
- You're handing off mission dispatch to another system (CI, a team workflow) and want Kōan to be a quiet executor.
- Multi-bot setups where only one instance should pick up issues autonomously.
- Per-project: focus some repos while allowing exploration on others.

## Intermediate — Productivity Workflows

These features turn Kōan from a task runner into a full development workflow partner.

### Code Operations

**`/brainstorm`** — Decompose a broad topic into 3-8 high-leverage GitHub sub-issues grouped under a master tracking issue.

The decomposer runs as a senior-engineer-style ideation pass: it explores the codebase (if provided) or external source, hunts for compounding improvements, and refuses to pad with generic refactors. Every sub-issue body follows this template:

```markdown
## Why This Matters
<leverage rationale — why this is unusual or high-leverage>

## Approach
<concrete implementation strategy, grounded in real files and patterns>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Risks & Caveats
<hidden complexity, operational risk, maintenance burden>

## Scores
- Impact:          ████████░░ 8/10
- Difficulty:      ██████░░░░ 6/10
- Short-Term ROI:  ███████░░░ 7/10
- Long-Term Value: █████████░ 9/10

## Priority
Immediate | Prototype First | Research Further | Skip

## Dependencies
<SUB-N references to other sub-issues, or "None">
```

The master tracking issue then synthesizes the set with three optional sections:

- **Top Ranked** — sub-issues ordered by ROI / feasibility / strategic value, each with a one-line rationale.
- **Fast Wins** — bucketed by horizon: `< 1 day`, `< 1 week`, `< 1 month`.
- **Overall Assessment** — short critical verdict on whether the initiative is worth pursuing and what to prioritize.

- **Usage:** `/brainstorm <topic>`, `/brainstorm <project> <topic>`, `/brainstorm <topic> --tag <label>`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /brainstorm <topic>` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/brainstorm Improve caching strategy for API responses` — Creates 3-8 sub-issues + master issue
- `/brainstorm koan Add observability and monitoring` — Target a specific project
- `/brainstorm Refactor auth module --tag auth-refactor` — With explicit tag for grouping
</details>

**`/plan`** — Deep-think an idea and produce a structured implementation plan as a tracker issue.

- **Usage:** `/plan <idea>`, `/plan <project> <idea>`, `/plan <issue-url>` (iterate on existing)
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /plan <idea>` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/plan Add WebSocket support for real-time notifications` — Get a phased plan before writing any code
- `/plan https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Iterate on an existing issue's plan
- `/plan https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123` — Iterate on a Jira issue's plan
- `/plan https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123 branch:main` — Iterate with an explicit base-branch hint
- `/plan webapp Add rate limiting to public API endpoints` — Target a specific project
</details>

For URL-based `/plan`, `/deepplan`, `/implement`, and `/fix`, Kōan resolves the project
from the issue URL and the known project registry. Known projects include both
`projects.yaml` entries and repositories discovered under `KOAN_ROOT/workspace/`,
so an explicit project prefix is not required when the URL maps to one of
those projects.

For URL-based `/plan`, `/deepplan`, `/implement`, and `/fix`, you can append
`branch:<name>` to override the base branch for that mission (for `/plan` and
`/deepplan`, this is passed as a planning hint in the generated context).

**`/deepplan`** — Spec-first design with Socratic exploration of 2-3 approaches before planning. For complex missions where design matters more than speed.

- **Usage:** `/deepplan <idea>`, `/deepplan <project> <idea>`, `/deepplan <issue-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/deeplan`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /deepplan <idea>` on an issue

The workflow: (1) explores your codebase and surfaces 2-3 distinct design approaches with trade-offs, (2) runs a spec review loop (up to 5 iterations) to ensure the spec is concrete and complete, (3) posts the approved spec to the configured issue tracker, (4) queues a `/plan <issue-url>` mission for your review and approval.

When given an issue URL, the issue title, body, and all comments are fetched to provide full context for the design exploration.

Use this before `/plan` when the idea is architecturally complex, when you want to explore alternatives before committing, or when design mistakes would be expensive to fix later.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/deepplan Refactor the auth middleware to support OAuth2` — Explore design approaches before writing any code
- `/deepplan koan Add multi-tenant project isolation` — Target a specific project with spec-first design
- `/deepplan https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Deep plan from an existing GitHub issue with full context
- `/deepplan https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123` — Deep plan from an existing Jira issue
- `/deepplan Redesign the mission queue for concurrent execution` — Surface trade-offs for a complex architectural change
</details>

**`/implement`** — Queue an implementation mission for a GitHub or Jira issue. Never bails on ambiguity — resolves blockers with the simplest viable solution and retries once before surfacing a problem.

- **Usage:** `/implement <issue-url> [additional context]`
- **Aliases:** `/impl`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /implement` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Implement what the issue describes
- `/implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42 Focus on the backend only` — Add guidance
- `/implement https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123 phase 1 only` — Implement a Jira-backed plan and post the PR link back to Jira
</details>

> **Blocker handling:** When the plan is ambiguous or under-specified, `/implement` chooses the simplest interpretation consistent with existing code patterns, documents the assumption in a commit message, and delivers a draft PR. If the first pass produces no committed changes, an escalated retry pass runs automatically. Only a genuine hard impossibility (no repo access, no actionable plan) results in a soft failure notification.  

**`/fix`** — Fix a GitHub or Jira issue end-to-end: understand, plan, test, implement, and submit a PR.

- **Usage:** `/fix <issue-url> [additional context]`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /fix` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/fix https://github.com/org/repo/issues/99` — Full bug-fix pipeline
- `/fix https://github.com/org/repo/issues/99 Regression from v2.3` — Provide extra context
- `/fix https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123 branch:main` — Fix a Jira ticket using a one-off target branch
</details>

**`/review`** — Queue a code review for a pull request or issue.

- **Usage:** `/review <github-pr-or-issue-url> [--architecture] [--errors] [--comments] [--plan-url <issue-url>]`
- **Aliases:** `/rv`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /review` on a PR
- **Flags:**
  - `--architecture` — Architecture-focused review (SOLID principles, layering, coupling, abstraction boundaries)
  - `--errors` — Run an additional **silent-failure-hunter** pass that scans for swallowed exceptions, silent null returns, unhandled promises, and other silent error paths. Also auto-triggered when the diff contains error-handling patterns (`try/except`, `catch`, etc.)
  - `--comments` — Comment quality review (factual accuracy, completeness, stale TODOs, misleading language)

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55` — Get a thorough code review
- `/rv https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55` — Same thing, shorter
- `/review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55 --architecture` — Architecture-focused review
- `/review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55 --errors` — Include silent-failure-hunter analysis
- `/review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55 --comments` — Comment quality review
- `/review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55 --architecture --errors` — Both passes
</details>

**`/explain`** — Explain a PR's intent and changes in plain, simple language.

- **Usage:** `/explain <github-pr-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/xp`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /explain` on a PR

Produces a pedagogical walkthrough of the PR: what problem it solves (with examples), how the fix works step-by-step, the data flow after the change, and whether a simpler approach could have worked.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/explain https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55` — Get a plain-language explanation
- `/xp https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55` — Same thing, shorter
</details>

**`/refactor`** — Queue a targeted refactoring mission.

- **Usage:** `/refactor <github-url-or-path>`
- **Aliases:** `/rf`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /refactor` on a PR or issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/refactor https://github.com/org/repo/pull/60` — Refactor code in a PR
- `/rf https://github.com/org/repo/issues/70` — Refactor based on an issue description
</details>

### PR Management

**`/ask`** — Ask a question about a GitHub PR or issue and get an AI-generated reply posted directly to the thread.

- **Usage:** `/ask <github-comment-url>`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot ask <your question>` on any PR or issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `@koan-bot ask why does this test fail?` — Kōan investigates the thread context and replies on GitHub
- `@koan-bot ask what is the purpose of this PR?` — Get a structured explanation with context summary
- `/ask https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42#issuecomment-123456` — Reply to a specific comment
</details>

**`/rebase`** — Rebase a PR onto its base branch.

- **Usage:** `/rebase <pr-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/rb`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /rebase` on a PR

By default, Telegram `/rebase` only queues PRs created by this instance
(branch prefix match). Set `allow_rebase_foreign_prs: true` in
`instance/config.yaml` to allow rebasing other writable PRs.
By default, `/rebase` feedback analysis includes bot-authored comments
(`rebase_include_bot_feedback: true`). Set it to `false` to keep noisy
third-party CI/bot output out of the feedback prompt. Kōan's own comments
are always kept (never treated as bot output), so review feedback it left on
a previous iteration is available to a later rebase — important for combined
review + rebase flows.

When `/rebase` runs long, Kōan uses activity-aware limits for review and CI-fix phases: it allows long sessions when CLI output keeps flowing, but still aborts stalled phases after inactivity or a max-duration cap. If the review-feedback step *stalls* (idle/max-duration timeout), Kōan now restores the clean rebased checkpoint and still pushes the rebase (without partial feedback edits), so timeout noise does not discard a valid rebase. If the feedback step hits a *provider quota limit*, the rebase still stops so you can retry after quota reset. Any other transient feedback error remains best-effort and does not block pushing the rebase.

After completion, Kōan posts a structured comment on the PR with these sections:

1. **Summary** — Classifies the rebase (simple / with adjustments / with conflict resolution)
2. **Changes applied** — List of modifications beyond the rebase itself (review feedback, conflict resolution, CI fixes)
3. **Stats** — Diff summary (files changed, insertions, deletions)
4. **Actions performed** — Pipeline steps in a collapsible `<details>` block
5. **CI status** — Test/CI outcome

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/rebase https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` — Resolve conflicts and update the PR
</details>

**`/reviewrebase`** — Review a PR then rebase it, so review insights feed the rebase.

- **Usage:** `/reviewrebase <pr-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/rr`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /rr` on a PR

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/rr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` — Queues `/review` then `/rebase` in sequence
- Extra context after the URL is passed to the review step (e.g., `/rr <url> focus on error handling`)
</details>

**`/planimplement`** — Plan an issue then implement it, so plan insights feed the implementation.

- **Usage:** `/planimplement <issue-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/planimp`, `/planimpl`, `/planit`, `/plandoit`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /planit` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/planit https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Queues `/plan` then `/implement` in sequence
- Extra context after the URL is passed to both steps (e.g., `/planit <url> phase 1 only`)
</details>

**`/squash`** — Squash all PR commits into a single clean commit.

- **Usage:** `/squash <pr-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/sq`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /squash` on a PR

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/squash https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` — Clean up messy commit history before merge
</details>

**`/recreate`** — Re-implement a PR from scratch on a fresh branch. Useful when a PR has diverged too far.

- **Usage:** `/recreate <pr-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/rc`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /recreate` on a PR

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/recreate https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` — Start fresh when rebasing won't cut it
</details>

**`/pr`** — Review and update a GitHub pull request (interactive).

- **Usage:** `/pr <pr-url>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55` — Review a PR and apply updates
</details>

**`/branches`** — List koan branches and open PRs with recommended merge order and stats.

- **Usage:** `/branches [project_name]`
- **Aliases:** `/br`, `/prs`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/branches` — Show all koan branches for the default project with merge recommendations
- `/branches koan` — Show branches for a specific project
</details>

**`/check`** — Run project health checks on a PR or issue (rebase, review, plan as needed).

- **Usage:** `/check <pr-or-issue-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/inspect`

Kōan also **auto-forwards unresolved human review comments** on its open PRs. During the GitHub notification polling loop, `review_comment_dispatch` checks Kōan-created PRs for new review comments and creates missions to address the feedback — no explicit @mention required. Fingerprint-based deduplication (SHA-256 of sorted comment IDs) prevents re-dispatching the same set of comments. Bot comments are filtered out automatically.

Configure this behavior in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
review_dispatch:
  enabled: true            # Opt-in (default: false)
  cooldown_minutes: 30     # Min minutes between checks per project (default: 30)
```

To prevent the bot from replying to itself in review comment threads (and to cap thread depth), configure:

```yaml
review_reply:
  max_thread_depth: 5      # Stop replying after this many comments per thread (default: 5)
```

When the bot is the last poster in a thread and no human has followed up, the thread is excluded from future replies. This prevents self-reply loops where repeated `/review` runs keep adding replies to the same comment.

<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/check https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` — Let Kōan decide what a PR needs
- Reviewer leaves comments on a PR → next notification check creates a mission to address them
</details>

**`/check_need`** — Analyze whether a PR or issue is still needed given the current state of the repository.

- **Usage:** `/check_need <pr-or-issue-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/need`, `/needs`

Fetches the PR diff or issue description, compares it against the current main branch, and posts a detailed relevance analysis as a GitHub comment. The analysis covers whether changes have been superseded, are partially addressed, or remain fully valuable — with specific file-level evidence and a clear recommendation.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/check_need https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` — Check if a PR is still relevant after recent main branch changes
- `/need https://github.com/org/repo/issues/99` — Verify an issue hasn't been addressed already

</details>

**`/ci_check`** — Check and fix CI failures on a GitHub PR using Claude.

- **Usage:** `/ci_check <pr-url>`

Usually auto-triggered when CI fails after a `/rebase`, but can also be invoked manually. Fetches failure logs, checks out the PR branch, and runs Claude to attempt a fix. If the fix produces a commit, it force-pushes and re-enqueues the PR for CI monitoring.

<details>

### Scheduling Work

Kōan supports recurring missions that automatically re-queue at set intervals.

**`/daily`** — Schedule a mission to run every day.
- **Usage:** `/daily <text> [project:<name>]`

**`/hourly`** — Schedule a mission to run every hour.
- **Usage:** `/hourly <text> [project:<name>]`

**`/weekly`** — Schedule a mission to run every week.

> **Targeting a project:** the bracketed `[project:<name>]` form is recommended, but a trailing `project:<name>` (no brackets, at the end of the text) is also accepted — e.g. `/daily run the API audit project:webapp`. The same applies to `/every`.

**`/recurring`** — List, manage, or force-run recurring missions. All management actions are sub-commands of `/recurring`.
- **Usage:** `/recurring` (list), `/recurring resume <n>` (re-enable), `/recurring run [n]` (force immediate run), `/recurring pause <n>` (disable), `/recurring cancel <n>` (remove), `/recurring days <n> <days>` (day-of-week filter)
- **Aliases:** —

<details>

- `/recurring cancel 2` — Stop a recurring mission
</details>

### Automation Suggestions

When Kōan is idle (no pending missions, not in focus mode), it can proactively suggest recurring tasks tailored to your project. Suggestions are generated using a lightweight model that analyzes project learnings, existing recurring tasks, and patterns from other projects you manage.

Suggestions appear as Telegram messages with copy-pasteable commands — just forward the command back to activate it.

**Configuration** (`config.yaml`):

```yaml
suggestions:
  enabled: true              # Master switch (default: true)
  min_interval_hours: 24     # Cooldown between suggestions per project
  max_per_day: 2             # Daily cap per project
```

Suggestions are automatically deduplicated against existing recurring tasks. The feature only triggers in `implement` or `deep` autonomous modes (when there's enough budget to be useful).

### Ideas Backlog

Not ready to commit to a mission? Save it as an idea.

**`/idea`** — Add an idea to the backlog, or manage existing ideas.

- **Usage:**
  - `/idea <text>` — Add a new idea
  - `/idea <project> <text>` — Add idea for a specific project
  - `/idea promote <n>` — Promote idea #n to a mission
  - `/idea delete <n>` — Delete idea #n
- **Aliases:** `/buffer`

**`/ideas`** — List all ideas in the backlog.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/idea Maybe we should add GraphQL support` — Save for later
- `/ideas` — Browse the backlog
- `/idea promote 3` — "OK, let's do idea #3"
</details>

### Reflection & Journal

**`/reflect`** — Write a reflection to the shared journal. Both you and Kōan contribute to this shared space.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/stats` — Overall productivity snapshot
- `/stats webapp` — How's Kōan doing on a specific project?
</details>

### Understanding Quota Modes

Kōan automatically adapts its work intensity based on remaining API quota:

| Mode | Quota | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **DEEP** | >40% | Strategic work, thorough exploration, comprehensive reviews |
| **IMPLEMENT** | 15–40% | Focused development, quick wins, efficient execution |
| **REVIEW** | <15% | Read-only analysis, code audits, lightweight tasks |
| **WAIT** | <5% | Graceful pause until quota resets |

You don't need to manage this — Kōan adjusts automatically. Use `/quota` to see the current mode. If the internal estimate drifts from reality, use `/quota <N>` to override (e.g., `/quota 50` tells Kōan it has 50% remaining).

When the provider reports a hard quota/session limit, Kōan pauses immediately,
moves the current mission back to Pending, and resumes 10 minutes after the
reported reset time. If the reset time cannot be parsed, Kōan pauses for 5
hours.

### Exploration Mode

When exploration is enabled, Kōan may autonomously explore a project's codebase between missions — discovering improvements, noting issues, and building context.

**`/explore`** — Enable exploration or show status.
- **Usage:** `/explore [project|all|none]`
- **Aliases:** `/exploration`

**`/noexplore`** — Disable exploration for a project.
- **Usage:** `/noexplore [project]`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/explore webapp` — Let Kōan explore the webapp codebase
- `/explore all` — Enable exploration for all projects
- `/noexplore` — Disable exploration (focus on missions only)
</details>

### Autoreview Mode

When autoreview is enabled for a project, Kōan automatically queues `/review <pr-url>` then `/rebase <pr-url>` after any successful mission that creates a PR (and was not auto-merged). This provides an extra quality gate without manual intervention. Off by default.

**`/autoreview`** — Enable autoreview or show status.
- **Usage:** `/autoreview [project|all|none]`
- **Aliases:** `/auto_review`

**`/noautoreview`** — Disable autoreview for a project.
- **Usage:** `/noautoreview [project]`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/autoreview webapp` — Enable autoreview for webapp project
- `/autoreview all` — Enable autoreview for all projects
- `/noautoreview webapp` — Disable autoreview for webapp
</details>

### Workflow Example: Feature from Idea to PR

Here's a typical multi-step workflow combining several commands:

```
1. /idea Add rate limiting to the public API          # Save the idea
2. /idea promote 1                                     # Ready to work on it
3. /plan Add rate limiting to the public API           # Get a structured plan
4. /implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123   # Implement the plan
5. /review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/124        # Review the result
6. # Merge the PR on GitHub when satisfied
```

---

## Power User — Advanced Configuration

Unlock Kōan's full potential with advanced configuration and extensibility features.

### Parallel Sessions

Kōan can work on multiple missions simultaneously using **git worktrees** for isolation. Each parallel session runs in its own worktree with a dedicated branch, so sessions never interfere with each other.

#### How It Works

When parallel sessions are enabled, Kōan can pick up additional pending missions while one is already running. Each session gets:

- **Isolated worktree** — a separate checkout of the repository under `.worktrees/`
- **Dedicated branch** — `koan/session-<id>` branches created automatically
- **Independent subprocess** — a Claude Code process running in the worktree

Sessions are coordinated through a persistent registry (`instance/sessions.json`) with file-level locking for process safety.

#### Configuration

Add `max_parallel_sessions` to your `instance/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Parallel session configuration
max_parallel_sessions: 2    # Number of concurrent sessions (1-5, default: 2)
```

Set to `1` to disable parallel execution and use the classic sequential mode.

#### Shared Dependencies

To avoid duplicating heavy dependency directories across worktrees, configure `shared_deps` in your project's `projects.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  webapp:
    path: ~/Code/webapp
    shared_deps:
      - node_modules
      - .venv
```

These directories are symlinked from the main project into each worktree, saving disk space and setup time.

> **Note:** Shared deps are best used for read-only caches. If a mission's build step modifies dependencies (e.g., `npm install`), it may affect other sessions sharing the same directory.

#### Monitoring

Parallel sessions appear in the standard status commands:

- **`/status`** — Shows count of active parallel sessions
- **`/live`** — Shows progress of all running sessions

Session output is captured to temporary files and collected when each session completes.

#### Cleanup

Worktrees and session branches are automatically cleaned up when a session finishes (success or failure). On startup, Kōan also recovers stale sessions from previous crashes — marking them as failed and removing their worktrees.

To manually clean up orphaned worktrees:

```bash
# From the project directory
git worktree list    # See all worktrees
git worktree prune   # Remove stale references
```

### Deep Exploration

**`/ai`** — Queue an AI exploration mission. Runs as a full agent mission with codebase access — deeper and more thorough than `/magic`.

- **Usage:** `/ai [project]`
- **Aliases:** `/ia`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/ai webapp` — Deep dive into a project, discover insights, suggest improvements
- `/ai` — Explore the default/focused project
</details>

**`/deep`** — Launch a thorough autonomous exploration session. Full tool access (Read, Grep, Bash), higher turn limits, and structured mission output. Goes deeper than `/ai` — traces execution paths, checks test coverage, finds real bugs.

- **Usage:** `/deep [project] [focus context]`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/deep koan` — Thorough exploration of the koan project
- `/deep koan error handling` — Focused deep dive on error handling patterns
- `/deep` — Deep explore a random project
</details>

**`/magic`** — Instant creative exploration. Quick single-turn analysis without queuing a mission.

- **Usage:** `/magic [project]`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/magic` — "Surprise me — what's interesting in this codebase?"
- `/magic api` — Quick creative scan of a specific project
</details>

**`/sparring`** — Start a strategic sparring session. This is about thinking, not code — Kōan challenges your assumptions and pushes your ideas.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/sparring` — "Challenge me on my architecture decisions"
</details>

### Configuration Deep-Dive

All behavioral config lives in `instance/config.yaml`. Key settings:

```yaml
# Work intensity
max_runs_per_day: 10          # Max missions per day
interval_seconds: 60          # Seconds between mission checks

# Model selection
models:
  mission: null               # Default (sonnet) for mission work
  chat: null                  # Default for chat replies
  lightweight: haiku          # Quick tasks (formatting, picking)
  review_mode: null           # Override autonomous review mode and /review

# Budget thresholds
budget:
  warn_at_percent: 20         # Warn when quota drops below
  stop_at_percent: 5          # Stop working below this

# Usage estimation mode
usage:
  session_token_limit: 500000 # Tokens per 5h window
  weekly_token_limit: 5000000 # Tokens per 7-day window
  budget_mode: session_only   # full | session_only | disabled

# Tool restrictions (limit what the agent can do)
tools:
  allowed: []                 # Whitelist (empty = all allowed)
  blocked: []                 # Blacklist specific tools

# Start on pause — boot directly into pause mode
# Useful for scheduled launches (cron, launchd) where you want
# the stack running but idle until you explicitly /resume.
start_on_pause: false

# Multiple instances sharing one GitHub account — suppresses
# warnings about @mentions on repos not in this instance's projects.yaml.
enable_multiple_instances: false

# Shared GitHub/Jira notification polling guard. Provider-specific
# github/jira settings can override this, but the shared setting is preferred.
# When auto_pause is false, quiet idle loops still wait for this backoff
# instead of repeatedly re-planning with no work.
notification_polling:
  check_interval_seconds: 60
  max_check_interval_seconds: 300

# Schedule (when Kōan is allowed to work)
schedule:
  timezone: UTC
  active_hours: "00:00-23:59" # Default: always active

# Skill execution limits
skill_timeout: 3600           # Max seconds for /fix, /implement, /incident
first_output_timeout: 600     # Kill silent skills after N seconds (0 disables)
rebase_first_output_timeout: 1800  # Optional longer silence budget for /rebase
rebase_review_idle_timeout: 1800   # /rebase review phase: kill on inactivity
rebase_review_max_duration: 10800  # /rebase review phase: absolute cap
rebase_ci_idle_timeout: 1800       # /rebase CI-fix phase: kill on inactivity
rebase_ci_max_duration: 7200       # /rebase CI-fix phase: absolute cap
rebase_include_bot_feedback: true  # Include bot-authored PR comments in feedback analysis (set false to filter them out)
allow_rebase_foreign_prs: false    # Telegram /rebase can target non-instance PRs
strip_co_authored_by: false        # Strip Co-Authored-By trailers from generated commits (set true to enable)
skill_max_turns: 200          # Max agentic turns for heavy skills

# Stagnation detection — kill Claude sessions stuck in a loop early
# (identical trailing stdout hash across `abort_after_cycles` samples).
# Prevents quota burn when Claude keeps retrying the same failing tool.
# Stagnated missions are re-queued for retry up to `max_retry_on_stagnation`
# times before being marked Failed, since a fresh start often unsticks Claude.
stagnation:
  enabled: true               # Set false to disable globally
  check_interval_seconds: 60  # How often to sample subprocess stdout
  abort_after_cycles: 3       # Identical samples required to kill (min 2)
  sample_lines: 50            # Trailing lines hashed each sample
  max_retry_on_stagnation: 3  # Stagnation requeues before marking Failed (0 disables retry)

# Prompt guard (content safety)
prompt_guard:
  enabled: true               # Enable prompt injection detection (default: true)
  block_mode: true            # true = reject mission (default), false = warn + quarantine

# Output optimizations — caveman directive ("no filler, 3–6 word sentences,
# direct answers"). ``enabled`` controls the agent loop (default true);
# skills are opt-in via SKILL.md ``caveman: true`` or this ``include`` list.
optimizations:
  caveman:
    enabled: true
    include: []                # canonical skill names, aliases auto-resolved

# Review ignore — exclude files from /review PR diffs
# Reduces token spend on generated/vendored code
# review_ignore:
#   glob:
#     - "vendor/**"    # all files under vendor/
#     - "*.lock"       # lock files at any depth
#   regex:
#     - '.*\.pb\.go$'  # protobuf-generated files (full path regex)
```

See `instance.example/config.yaml` for all available options.

`usage.budget_mode: disabled` turns off Koan's internal token-budget gating.
Hard provider quota/session-limit errors are still detected from CLI output and
will still pause and requeue missions.

**`/models`** (alias `/model`) — Show the resolved model configuration for the active CLI provider. Useful when debugging model-routing issues — displays which model wins for each of the 6 slots (`mission`, `chat`, `lightweight`, `fallback`, `review_mode`, `reflect`) after applying the full resolution chain: per-project `models:` → `models_for_{provider}:` → global `models:` → built-in defaults.

```
/models
```

The active provider is also shown in `/status` output. See [Provider-specific model config](#provider-specific-model-config) below for how to configure `models_for_claude:` / `models_for_codex:` sections.

**`/config_check`** — Detect drift between your `instance/config.yaml` and the template at `instance.example/config.yaml`. Reports two things:

- **Missing keys** — in the template but absent from your config. These are new features released since you last synced and are probably worth reviewing.
- **Extra keys** — in your config but absent from the template. These are usually deprecated/removed settings (or typos).

Run it after every Kōan update to stay in sync:

```
/config_check
```

The same check runs automatically as part of `/doctor` — use `/config_check` when you only want the config slice without the rest of the diagnostic report.

### Health Check & Auto-Repair

**`/doctor`** — Run diagnostic self-checks on configuration, environment, instance structure, processes, projects, and connectivity.

```
/doctor           # Quick diagnostics
/doctor --full    # Include connectivity checks (Telegram, GitHub, CLI)
/doctor --fix     # Auto-repair common issues
```

The `--fix` mode safely repairs:
- **Stale PID files** — removes orphaned PID files when the process is no longer alive
- **Missions.md structural issues** — fixes duplicate headers, foreign sections
- **Stale in-progress missions** — recovers stuck missions back to Pending
- **Missing directories** — creates missing `memory/` and `journal/` directories

When `--fix` is not used, fixable issues are flagged with a hint to re-run with `--fix`.

### Remote HEAD Rescan

**`/rescan`** — Re-check all project workspaces for remote default branch changes (e.g. when a repository renames its default branch from `master` to `main`).

```
/rescan
```

Kōan also checks for remote HEAD changes automatically at startup (throttled to once every 12 hours). Use `/rescan` to force an immediate check across all projects. When a change is detected, the local workspace is updated: the symbolic ref is set, the new branch is fetched and created locally, and if the workspace was on the old branch, it's switched to the new one.

### Caveman Output Optimization

Caveman appends a "no filler, 3–6 word sentences, direct answers" directive to Claude prompts to reduce output tokens.

**Where it applies by default:**

- **Agent loop (regular missions)** — caveman is on by default. This is the highest-volume Claude entry point, so the directive yields the most savings here.
- **Skills and chat — opt-in.** A skill receives caveman only when it explicitly says so. New skills (core or custom) inherit *no* caveman until the author or operator turns it on.

**Core skills shipping with caveman opted in (`caveman: true`)** — these produce terse, status-style output where the directive helps:

| Skill | Why caveman fits |
|-------|------------------|
| `/rebase`, `/recreate`, `/squash` | Git-plumbing skills; output is mostly status |
| `/fix` | Focused issue-fix flow |
| `/ci_check` | Diagnostic, action-oriented |
| `/check` | PR/issue check report |
| `/implement` | Mission narration during implementation |

**Core skills shipping with caveman opted out (`caveman: false`)** — terseness directly hurts these (kept explicit for clarity, even though it matches the default):

`/plan`, `/deepplan`, `/review`, `/security_audit`, `/audit`, `/brainstorm`, `/sparring`, `/incident`, `/claudemd`, `/chat`.

**Operator override — the `include:` list:**

```yaml
optimizations:
  caveman:
    enabled: true
    include: [my_custom_skill, deeplan]   # aliases auto-resolved → deepplan
```

Names match **canonical command names**; aliases declared in `koan/app/skill_dispatch.py` (`deeplan` → `deepplan`, `security`/`secu` → `security_audit`, `private_security`/`psecu` → `private_security_audit`, …) resolve automatically. The operator's `include:` list overrides a SKILL.md `caveman: false`, giving instance owners the final say.

**Switching the global flag off** disables caveman everywhere — agent loop included:

```yaml
optimizations:
  caveman:
    enabled: false
```

**Custom skill authors:** add `caveman: true` to your SKILL.md frontmatter when your skill produces terse output that benefits from the directive — see `koan/skills/README.md`.

### Per-Project Overrides

Projects are configured in `projects.yaml` at `KOAN_ROOT`. Repositories under
`KOAN_ROOT/workspace/<name>` are also discovered automatically as projects;
add a `projects.yaml` entry when you need overrides such as model selection,
tracker routing, or a project name that differs from the directory name. Each
project can override defaults:

```yaml
defaults:
  git_auto_merge:
    enabled: false
    strategy: squash

projects:
  webapp:
    path: ~/Code/webapp
    cli_provider: claude       # CLI provider override
    models:
      mission: opus            # Use Opus for this project
      review_mode: sonnet      # Use Sonnet for review mode and /review
    tools:
      blocked: [WebSearch]     # Restrict certain tools
    git_auto_merge:
      enabled: true            # Auto-merge for this project
      strategy: squash
    issue_tracker:
      provider: jira           # github | jira
      jira_project: PROJ       # Jira project key for ticket routing
      jira_issue_type: Task    # Default type for issues Koan creates
      default_branch: main     # Target branch for Jira-triggered work
    authorized_users:          # Who can trigger via GitHub @mention
      - username1
```

Key per-project settings:
- **`cli_provider`** — `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `local`, or `ollama-launch`
- **`models`** — Override model selection per role
- **`tools`** — Restrict available tools
- **`git_auto_merge`** — Auto-merge completed PRs (strategy: squash/merge/rebase)
- **`issue_tracker`** — Issue provider routing for GitHub/Jira-backed projects
- **`security_review`** — Automatic diff analysis for dangerous patterns before auto-merge (see below)
- **`authorized_users`** — GitHub users allowed to trigger via @mention
- **`exploration`** — Enable/disable autonomous exploration

#### Security Review

When enabled, Kōan scans mission diffs for security-sensitive patterns before auto-merge:
- **Blast radius** — files changed, modules affected, infrastructure/dependency changes
- **Content patterns** — eval, exec, shell injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe deserialization, XSS, wildcard CORS, etc.
- **Risk classification** — low / medium / high / critical based on cumulative score

Results are logged to the project journal. In blocking mode, auto-merge is skipped when the risk level meets or exceeds the configured threshold.

```yaml
defaults:
  security_review:
    enabled: true              # Scan diffs for dangerous patterns
    blocking: false            # true = block auto-merge on high risk
    severity_threshold: high   # low / medium / high / critical
```

Per-project override example:
```yaml
projects:
  production-api:
    security_review:
      enabled: true
      blocking: true           # Block auto-merge for risky changes
      severity_threshold: medium
```

See [docs/security/security-review.md](../security/security-review.md) for the full list of detected patterns, risk scoring details, and pipeline integration.

### Custom Skills

Kōan's skill system is fully extensible. Install skills from Git repos or create your own.

**Install from Git:**
```
/skill install https://github.com/your-org/koan-skills.git
/skill approve <scope> <fingerprint>
/skill update <scope>
/skill remove <scope>
```

Freshly installed and scaffolded skills are **quarantined** until you approve
them. Kōan replies with a short hex fingerprint of the on-disk files; loaded
handlers are skipped by the registry until you run `/skill approve` with that
fingerprint. This blocks blind / prompt-injected installs from running code in
the bridge process. Inspect the files in `instance/skills/<scope>/` first.

Optional `config.yaml` allow-list to refuse clones outside trusted hosts
(defense-in-depth; the approval gate still applies if you do not set it):

```yaml
skills:
  allowed_hosts:
    - github.com/your-org
```

**Create your own:** Add a `SKILL.md` file in `instance/skills/<scope>/<name>/`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
scope: my-scope
description: What this skill does
audience: bridge
commands:
  - name: mycommand
    description: One-line description
    usage: /mycommand <args>
handler: handler.py
---
```

The handler follows a simple pattern:

```python
def handle(ctx):
    # ctx.args — command arguments
    # ctx.project — current project
    # ctx.instance_dir — instance directory path
    return "Response message"  # or None for no reply
```

For prompt-only skills (no handler), put the prompt text after the YAML frontmatter — it's sent directly to Claude.

**Scaffold a skill from a description:**

Instead of writing SKILL.md and handler.py by hand, use `/scaffold_skill` to generate them:

```
/scaffold_skill myteam deploy Deploy to production with rollback support
```

This invokes Claude to produce a valid SKILL.md + handler.py stub in `instance/skills/myteam/deploy/`, validated against the parser before writing. Restart the bridge to load the new skill.

See [koan/skills/README.md](../../koan/skills/README.md) for the full authoring guide.

### GitHub @mention Integration

Ten skills can be triggered by commenting `@koan-bot <command>` on GitHub issues and PRs:

| Skill | GitHub trigger |
|-------|---------------|
| `/brainstorm` | `@koan-bot /brainstorm <topic>` on an issue |
| `/implement` | `@koan-bot /implement` on an issue |
| `/fix` | `@koan-bot /fix` on an issue |
| `/review` | `@koan-bot /review` on a PR |
| `/rebase` | `@koan-bot /rebase` on a PR |
| `/reviewrebase` | `@koan-bot /rr` on a PR |
| `/planimplement` | `@koan-bot /planit` on an issue |
| `/recreate` | `@koan-bot /recreate` on a PR |
| `/refactor` | `@koan-bot /refactor` on a PR or issue |
| `/plan` | `@koan-bot /plan <idea>` on an issue |
| `/profile` | `@koan-bot /profile` on a PR or issue |

Setup requires configuring `github_nickname` and `github_commands_enabled` in `config.yaml`. See [docs/messaging/github-commands.md](../messaging/github-commands.md) for full setup and configuration details.

### CLI Providers

Kōan supports multiple CLI backends. Configure globally via `KOAN_CLI_PROVIDER` env var or per-project in `projects.yaml`.

| Provider | Best for | Docs |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Claude Code** (default) | Full-featured agent, best reasoning | [claude.md](../providers/claude.md) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | ChatGPT users who want Codex models | [codex.md](../providers/codex.md) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Teams with existing Copilot licenses | [copilot.md](../providers/copilot.md) |
| **Local LLM** | Offline, privacy, zero API cost | [local.md](../providers/local.md) |

#### Provider-specific model config

When switching between providers, model names are not interchangeable. Use `models_for_claude:` / `models_for_codex:` sections in `instance/config.yaml` to configure provider-specific defaults without touching the global `models:` fallback:

```yaml
cli_provider: "codex"

# Provider-specific overrides (resolved before global models:)
models_for_codex:
  mission: "gpt-5.5"
  chat: "gpt-5.5"
  lightweight: "gpt-5.4-mini"
  fallback: ""              # empty = use provider default
  review_mode: "gpt-5.3-codex"
  reflect: "gpt-5.5"

models_for_claude:
  review_mode: "haiku"      # use haiku for cheaper REVIEW mode audits

# Global fallback for providers without a specific section
models:
  lightweight: "haiku"
  fallback: "sonnet"
```

Resolution order per key: per-project `models:` → `models_for_{provider}:` → global `models:` → built-in default.

Use `/models` to inspect the resolved values for the active provider at any time.

### Language Preference

**`/language`** — Set or reset the reply language.

- **Usage:** `/language <lang>`, `/language reset`
- **Aliases:** `/lng`

**`/french`** / **`/english`** — Quick language switches.

- **Aliases:** `/fr`, `/francais`, `/français` / `/en`, `/anglais`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/fr` — Switch to French replies
- `/en` — Switch back to English
- `/language reset` — Use default language
</details>

### System Management

**`/pause`** — Pause mission processing. Kōan stays running but won't pick up new missions.

- **Aliases:** `/sleep`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/pause` — Temporarily stop mission work without shutting down
- Resume with `/resume` when ready
</details>

**`/resume`** — Resume mission processing after a pause (manual or automatic).

- **Aliases:** `/work`, `/awake`, `/run`, `/start`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/resume` — Unpause after a manual `/pause` or quota exhaustion
</details>

**`/shutdown`** — Shutdown both the agent loop and the messaging bridge.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/shutdown` — Gracefully stop everything (e.g., before system maintenance)
</details>

**`/update`** — Finish the current mission, pull updates, and restart.

- **Aliases:** `/upgrade`
- Graceful update: waits for the current mission to complete before pulling and restarting.
- If the update fails, Kōan still restarts (you asked for it).
- Use `/restart` if you just need a fresh start without pulling code.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/update` — "Finish what you're doing, update yourself, and come back"
- `/upgrade` — Same as `/update`
</details>

**`/reset`** — Reset the run counter to 0 without restarting. If Kōan is paused because it reached `max_runs`, `/reset` also resumes execution.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/reset` — Reset counter mid-session when you want more runs
- `/reset` — Resume from a max_runs pause without losing current state
</details>

**`/restart`** — Restart both agent and bridge processes without pulling new code.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/restart` — Force a restart when Kōan is already up to date but you need a fresh start
</details>

**`/snapshot`** — Export memory state to a portable snapshot file for backup or migration.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/snapshot` — Back up Kōan's memory before a major change
</details>

### Memory System

Kōan maintains persistent memory across sessions through several interconnected files:

- **`memory/summary.md`** — Global summary of learnings across all projects
- **`memory/projects/<name>/`** — Per-project learnings and context
- **`journal/YYYY-MM-DD/project.md`** — Daily logs of what Kōan did
- **`soul.md`** — Agent personality definition (see [Personality Customization](#personality-customization))

Memory is automatically compacted over time. Kōan uses it to build context for each mission, remembering past decisions, patterns, and mistakes.

#### Memory Compaction

Kōan runs automatic memory maintenance every 24 hours (configurable) during the startup cleanup cycle:

1. **Learnings dedup** — Removes exact-duplicate lines from `learnings.md` files
2. **Semantic compaction** — Uses Claude (lightweight model) to merge redundant entries, remove references to deleted code, and consolidate by topic. Cross-references the project's file tree to identify obsolete entries.
3. **Hard cap** — Safety-net truncation that keeps only the most recent entries if the file is still too large after compaction
4. **Global memory rotation** — Truncates append-only files (`personality-evolution.md`, `emotional-memory.md`) to prevent unbounded growth

Configure thresholds in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
memory:
  learnings_max_lines: 100        # Target after semantic compaction
  learnings_hard_cap: 200         # Absolute max (safety net)
  global_personality_max: 150     # Max lines for personality-evolution.md
  global_emotional_max: 100       # Max lines for emotional-memory.md
  compaction_interval_hours: 24   # How often cleanup runs
```

Manual compaction via CLI: `python3 memory_manager.py <instance_dir> compact-learnings [project]`

### Personality Customization

Edit `instance/soul.md` to define Kōan's personality. This file shapes how Kōan communicates, what tone it uses, and what personality traits it exhibits. It's loaded into every interaction.

The design principle: code is generic and open source; instance data (including personality) is private. Fork the repo, write your own soul.

### CI Dispatch

Kōan can automatically create fix missions when CI fails on its own PRs. When enabled, each iteration checks open Koan-authored PRs for failing check runs and inserts a fix mission with the failure log snippet. Dedup prevents re-dispatching the same failure.

```yaml
ci_dispatch:
  enabled: true              # Master switch (default: false)
  cooldown_minutes: 30       # Min time between checks per project (default: 30)
  log_snippet_bytes: 4096    # Max CI log snippet in mission text (default: 4096)
```

### Auto-Update

Kōan can automatically check for and apply updates from upstream. Configure in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
auto_update:
  enabled: true
  check_interval: 3600    # Seconds between checks
  notify: true             # Notify via Telegram when updating
```

See [docs/operations/auto-update.md](../operations/auto-update.md) for details.

</details>

### Spec-Drift Audit

**`/spec_audit`** — Check that documentation (user-manual.md, github-commands.md, CLAUDE.md) stays in sync with the actual codebase. Produces a divergence report saved to project learnings, and queues fix missions for each finding.

- **Usage:** `/spec_audit [project-name]`
- **Aliases:** `/sa`, `/drift`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/spec_audit koan` — Audit docs alignment for the koan project
- `/sa` — Audit the default project
- Set up as a recurring mission: `/weekly /spec_audit` for continuous drift detection
</details>

### Codebase Audit

**`/audit`** — Audit a project for optimizations, simplifications, and potential issues. Creates a GitHub issue for each finding with detailed problem description, impact analysis, suggested fix, and severity/effort classification.

- **Usage:** `/audit <project-name> [extra context] [limit=N]`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /audit` on an issue or PR
- Default: top 5 most important findings. Use `limit=N` to override.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/audit webapp focus on the auth module` — Audit with specific focus
- `/audit mylib look for performance bottlenecks limit=10` — Targeted audit with custom limit
</details>

Each finding becomes a GitHub issue with:
- **Problem** — What's wrong and why it matters
- **Why This Matters** — Impact on bugs, performance, or maintainability
- **Suggested Fix** — Concrete description of what to change
- **Details table** — Severity, category, location, and effort estimate

### Security Audit

**`/security_audit`** — Perform a security-focused SDLC audit of a project. Searches for critical vulnerabilities (injection, auth flaws, secrets exposure, path traversal, SSRF, insecure deserialization, etc.) and creates a GitHub issue for each finding.

- **Usage:** `/security_audit <project-name> [extra context] [limit=N]`
- **Aliases:** `/security`, `/secu`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /security_audit` on an issue or PR
- Default: top 5 most critical findings. Use `limit=N` to override.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/security_audit koan` — Full security audit (top 5 critical findings)
- `/security myapp focus on the API endpoints` — Security audit with specific focus
- `/secu webapp limit=3` — Quick security scan with custom limit
</details>

Each finding becomes a GitHub issue with:
- **Problem** — The vulnerability and how it could be exploited
- **Why This Matters** — Real-world impact (data breach, RCE, privilege escalation)
- **Suggested Fix** — Concrete remediation steps
- **Details table** — Severity, category, location, and effort estimate

**Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVRS):** When the target repository has GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting enabled, critical and high severity findings are automatically submitted as private security advisories instead of public issues. This prevents disclosure of exploitable vulnerabilities before a fix is applied. Lower-severity findings still create public issues.

Configure PVRS behavior per-project in `projects.yaml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  security:
    pvrs: auto          # auto (detect), true (force), false (public only)
    pvrs_threshold: high # minimum severity for PVRS (critical, high, medium, low)
projects:
  myapp:
    security:
      pvrs: false  # always use public issues for this project
```

### Private Security Audit

**`/private_security_audit`** — Same security analysis as `/security_audit`, but findings are written **only** to today's project journal. Nothing is posted to GitHub: no public issues, no Private Vulnerability Reports. Use this when you want a security review without disclosing any details to GitHub — for example, while triaging a sensitive area before deciding what to share.

- **Usage:** `/private_security_audit <project-name> [extra context] [limit=N]`
- **Aliases:** `/private_security`, `/psecu`
- Default: top 5 most critical findings. Use `limit=N` to override.
- **Output:** appended to `instance/journal/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<project>.md` under a `🔒 Private Security Audit` heading, plus a summary file at `instance/memory/projects/<project>/private_security_audit.md`.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/private_security_audit koan` — Full audit, findings stay local
- `/psecu webapp focus on token handling limit=3` — Focused review, kept off GitHub
</details>

### Incident Triage

**`/incident`** — Triage a production error from a stack trace or log snippet. Kōan will parse the error, identify the root cause, propose a fix with tests, and submit a draft PR.

- **Usage:** `/incident <error text or stack trace>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/incident TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined at UserService.getUser (user.js:42)` — Paste a stack trace and get a fix
</details>

### Web Dashboard

Run `make dashboard` to start a local web UI on port 5001. The dashboard provides:

- Real-time status overview
- Mission queue management
- Chat interface
- Journal browsing

The dashboard binds to `localhost` only — not accessible from the network.

### Deployment

For advanced deployment scenarios, see the existing documentation:

- [Docker deployment](../setup/docker.md)
- [SSH tunnel setup](../setup/ssh-setup.md)
- [Always-up Railway deployment](../design/spec-always-up-railway.md)
